Los Angeles: Oasis of the Dreamer
    It takes a lot to make a man trek across the American Heartland.  It takes more than just opportunities to convince a man to cross the Rocky Mountains.  It takes a dream.  Ever since Los Angeles became part of the United States it has boasted financial freedom and independence to whoever would make the journey.  Advertisements made claims that it was a place where one could make his fortune without interference from the government.  It was a sort of Mecca for those who had immigrated to the United States hoping to find new opportunities that had already run out on the east coast.  The promise of wealth and freedom lured many toward this desert town.
    Advertisements today still boast of the opportunities and livelihood one might find in Los Angeles.  In the purest form, every advertisement is attempting to offer the American Dream itself to the consumer. Whether it be the assurance that a new coffee table will provide the culture missing from one’s loft or that a new alarm system will provide families with the security needed to be happy, ads are selling the American Dream in some form or another.  However, the American Dream can not be clearly constrained to a single definition.  It is not a diamond to be examined under a microscope but rather a far away oasis among unfamiliar terrain covered in a thick haze.  If one squints toward this oasis for long enough one can at least deduce that material prosperity is a necessary element in making this dream a reality.  There is certainly much more to the American Dream than wealth, but just as an oasis is nothing without fresh water the other elements of the American Dream are dependant on financial stability.  
One can achieve financial independence and not necessarily have realized the American Dream, but one can not realize the American Dream without some sense of material prosperity beyond what is immediately necessary.  This is clearly backed up in an advertisement for Tower Records frequently found in the Los Angeles Times.  In this ad several males are depicted in expensive suits sitting around a table at a fancy restaurant.  No food can be seen, so this is a visit of leisure rather than one of physiological needs.  The table is adorned only with wine bottles and near empty glasses.  If the ad is treated as an advertisement for the American Dream itself, the ad concludes that the American Dream is a dream of excess.  It is not only about providing for what one needs but also one’s desires.
    This is not a dream available to all, however.  Due to the large class gaps existing in Los Angeles, only some are even given the opportunity to strive toward this dream.  This expansive crevice between the lower class and the target audience of these ads is so present in this city that it diffuses into the products of the city’s culture.  Advertisements for the Wilshire Highrise display an attractive, young female in a dress sipping a martini while enjoying the view from her condominium.  The ad beckons for cultured citizens who enjoy martinis to pre-qualify for these half-million dollar lofts.  On closer inspection she appears to actually be scoffing at the thousands of headlights blurred together on the streets below.  It is clearly late, late enough for this woman to return to her place of residence.  These cars are not speeding off to night clubs and movie premiers.  They are transporting the night shift to work.  While many cities are known for their beautiful skylines, only Los Angeles is known for its glowing streets from the glare of headlights at all hours of the night.  In effect, hundreds of people contributed to the image used in this ad, as it would not be the same at all if all the factories were closed and all the streets vacant.  Yet, the only person of importance is the woman in the dress.  The ad itself recognizes that this lower class of late night commuters is necessary for the highrise’s breathtaking view.  It is also a very proportional representation of the city’s distribution of wealth: For every thousand minimum wage employees barely able to make ends meet there is one elite able to realize the city’s dream.
    Of course, it is certainly possible that this woman once worked these late nights herself.  She could have simply been more dedicated than the older men and women who worked the graveyard shift for a much greater portion of their lives than her.  However, an ad for the Little Tokyo Lofts presents a concept that makes this very unlikely.  This ad states that “(a)fter years of telling people you live in L.A., isn’t it time you actually lived in L.A.?”  It tells its audience that an address is an important judgment of character.  Just like a nice suit is necessary to make a good impression at a job interview, a well-known loft listed on a résumé is important to show class.  This self-perpetuating cycle requires a prosperous lifestyle before one can afford it.  This ad also separates Los Angeles into two distinct zones: the core of Los Angeles and the surrounding area that it implies is not actually Los Angeles.  The American Dream in Los Angeles is only available to those who actually live in the heart of Los Angeles and not the more affordable properties in the hinterlands.
    Those that live in the hinterlands may scan the advertisements with envy, but they know that the ads are not meant for their eyes anyway.  The Tokyo Lofts ad mentions starting prices in the $300,000 range and the Wilshire Highrise’s ad boasts an American Dream starting in the high $400,000s.  There are much more implicit signs that these ads are not targeted at anyone below this elite status as well.  Both of these ads contain the term “pre-qualify.”  To pre-qualify one must have a steady source of documented income and a credit report clean of delinquencies.  The working class is more commonly paid based on commission, under the table, or in tips than the upper class.  Therefore one must not only have the necessary funds but also be in the spectrum of suitable occupations to be approved.  Additionally, an American Express advertisement often seen in LA Weekly displays an older woman in a pink and white collared shirt with a dachshund in a matching outfit.  Her own clothing represents what could be considered necessary but the puppy’s attire is purely frivolous spending.  This ad is targeted at only those who can afford this sort of lifestyle.  Additionally, the ad can only be responded to online, sending a definite message:  If you do not have the internet in your household, you will not be approved for this card.  Advertisements in Los Angeles for the American Dream are excluding the hardest working of its inhabitants.
    Los Angeles is perceived as a place where hard work and talent can really pay off.  The film industry in Hollywood is one of the few industries where an employee, such as an actor, can actually make much more money than the film company they are working for.  Big name actors are paid millions to star in movies with no commercial success quite frequently.  In general, when someone works for a company and earns a dollar it is only because they provide the company with profit greater than a dollar.  This is even truer in Los Angeles due of the high percentage of employees working under the table for less than minimum wage.  So while one may think that if he pays his dues to society and works hard enough for long enough he can transcend the class gap, all he is actually doing is broadening the class gap.  Just as the lower class is supporting the image of the Los Angeles skyline with the blurred headlights, the lower class is also providing the income for the classes above them.  The higher he climbs up the class ladder, the further away the top becomes.  
To see evidence of this in advertisements one must look at what is not displayed.  No ghettos are shown in any ad here.  The ads contain only attractive white men and women.  No one is seen doing anything that can even be construed as work.  No evidence of life is displayed in the immaculate lofts.  The people portrayed in these acts – the same ones who have realized the Dream in Los Angeles – did not earn their status.  Their lifestyle is dependant upon those who drive the cars whose blurred headlights make the streaks where vacant streets should be.  It seems that to obtain the American Dream in this city one must already have all the amenities that are the result of having obtained the dream already.  Although very few may somehow transcend the class gap, the severe economical imbalances between classes and cyclical nature of the American Dream in Los Angeles makes it inherently flawed and unachievable on any wide scale. 
    The American Dream can be thought of as an oasis in the distance.  Everyone has some perception or another of it, seeing the same dream from a different angle and with a different wind.  Los Angeles, too, can be thought of as an oasis surrounded by the desert.  Everyone comes with the dream of making a name of themselves and getting a new chance.  Unfortunately for America, some oases are really just mirages.

Assignment 2
A Slice of Bohemia
Its majestic skyline is emblematic to the American way of life.  Its expanding and encompassing design has redesigned the urban city.  Its profitability has spawned the modern business corporation.  Los Angeles ushered in a new era of society and culture.  Yet there exists an encampment with a nomadic feeling along the shoreline.  A bohemian countercultural society contained within six city blocks centralized at Third Street in the bay city of Santa Monica screams of a simpler time: A time when streets were built for carts not cars and business was a matter of acquaintanceship.  The Third Street Promenade is a European village in a post-European world.  This beautiful blending of art and business could easily be a model for the future of American commerce.
    It seems fitting that one can take in the salty ocean air while enjoying the landscaped dinosaur fountains that serve as centerpieces to streets void of automobiles.  With ease one can locate where the deep sky blue and the deep ocean blue become one in the same.  Ornate hexagonal tiles adorn the streets, which are dissected into two lanes by Victorian greenhouses and elaborate pools of water.   The sidewalks are spotted with vendor’s hawking their wares from eloquent carts.  Crowds frequently gather around singers in outlandish attire and dancers recreating classical routines from far away places – far away places where bazaars like the Third Street Promenade are commonplace.  
However, in Los Angeles such an encampment is anything but common.  The brilliance behind the concept, and the reason why it fits in this city, is because it is artful and profitable.  Prior to being a promenade, Third Street was a series of dilapidated storefronts and vacant parking structures.  After its advent taxable sales from the entire city increased by 440% all derived from an otherwise ordinary stretch of ghetto (Brinsley).  Santa Monica’s Third Street Promenade would seem to be the perfect balance between culture and capitalism, where a man can not only turn a huge profit but also build lasting memories and traditions, all on those six street blocks defended from the rapidly growing urbanization that surrounds them.  The Promenade, one of the most popular shopping districts in Los Angeles County, should, much like the skyline, be emblematic to the American way of life.  It should not only shape the American Dream, but due to its transformation of decay into something of financial and cultural significance, be a model and method one can use to achieve the American Dream, as well.
The American Dream is what lured many travelers from their simple east coast lifestyles to the frontier.  The thought of owning a farm in sunny southern California, relaxing and watching the oranges grow into golden coins in a place where the opera, the theatre and the art exhibition are all inexpensive and accessible created this urge to pack up and leave their old lives behind them.  Their old lives never quenched their thirst for wealth and always left them desiring a more cultured social life.  This balance between wealth, education and cultivation of the mind is in itself an American Dream and the dream of many who trekked westward to California.  This dream cannot be denied within the Third Street Promenade – provided one has a permit for such a dream.
While the Promenade masquerades as a marketplace where entertainers show off their skills in order to make an honest dollar, it is in fact simply bureaucratic regulations put into effect to create such a spontaneous atmosphere.  The entertainers audition for their permits and are allotted certain timeslots in which to perform their act.  This is not the sort bazaar that attracts talent and breathes culture, but rather a commercial district with unusual employees.  A timecard toting juggler is no more art than a waitress singing happy birthday at a colorful family-themed restaurant.  The Third Street Promenade tries so hard to present this idea of being a center of culture, attracting and demanding the skills of talented performers, but this presentation is only superficial.  Call it what it is: A business model for attracting customers solely for the purpose of profiting.
The history of these streets echoes this strictly corporate approach to the Promenade as well.  In the 1960’s it was converted into an open air shopping mall.  This was only successful in leaving behind vacant and useless storefronts and parking structures that had never reached capacity.  It was an attempt to get more profit out of the land, plain and simple.  The conversion in the mid 1980’s was a similar attempt.  The idea at the time was that if one would just pave an inch of tile over the asphalt and slap a coat of paint on the walls and it would be reborn as this great Arcadia within the city.  Ironically, what it became was a superficial re-creation of the places many immigrants left behind in search of the American Dream, such as Old Chicago and Greenwich Village.  These immigrants left these places in search of a land that offered them better opportunities for both material and social prosperity.  In an effort to deliver this, the land they arrived in now offers a glimpse at the life they, or more precisely their grandparents, left behind to pursue the American Dream – one of culture and of profit.
So long as the Promenade offered an opportunity for material growth, it could still be considered a valuable asset in attaining the American Dream here in Los Angeles.  While a bazaar would be populated by local tradesmen trading local goods, the Promenade is instead populated almost exclusively with large corporations such as Barnes and Noble and American Eagle Outfitters.  This is primarily due to the increasingly expensive cost of renting within the Promenade.  The rent per square foot quintupled between 1989 and 1999, forcing the “Ma and Pa” businesses out to make room for the Starbucks Hear Music Coffeehouse and the Apple Store (Brinsley).  Starbucks, Apple and American Eagle are turning big profits from this glamorized mall, but those profiting most from these corporations are those who already have material prosperity beyond what most citizens can even imagine.  This practice only contributes to creating a more exclusive American Dream, thus deforming the concept into a dream only available to few.
Perhaps the selective dream is a more attractive one to those who have already found material prosperity as it seems something they are willing to defend.  Santa Monica’s coastline may be adorned with antique cannons from battles that were never fought in its harbor, but there is a very real battle occurring in the areas surrounding the Promenade on a daily basis.  Cement barriers separate the streets of Santa Monica from the pedestrian zone of the Promenade.  Brochures released to encourage tourism state that the Promenade can be entered at no cost, raising the question: When does one ever have to pay a fee to walk down a certain street?  Do not think of those cement slabs as blockades, but rather consider them revolving doors to an indoor mall and more importantly – private property.  Since everyone has been allowed to enter without paying a fee to the mall’s generous administration, anyone can be asked to leave without having his or her fare refunded.  This idea is known as turning the American city “outside in.”  This localizes public activity to select regions, allowing the surrounding streets to serve simply as “sewers” and “waste receptacles” for a society that is too civilized to confront its problems (Davis 226).  This is all but a clever deterrent to minimize the homeless representation in Santa Monica.  
An even less subtle deterrent would be the ordinance that came into effect in January of 2003 preventing any charitable organization from providing food to the homeless unless they meet all the standards that would be required of restaurants operating to turn a profit.  These standards are extremely difficult to meet when the organization is not charging its “customers” for their meals.  The requirement for sinks in any facility that serves food puts the majority of soup kitchens, which were operating out of volunteer’s personal vehicles, out cold.  James Lafferty, Executive Director of the National Lawyer’s Guild, said that such standards would be impossible to follow for organizations that do not make a profit (Allardice).  All of this is merely an attempt to keep the homeless out of sight for the shoppers at the Third Street Promenade.  Not only is there bureaucracy in place to create the image of spontaneous street carts and performers drawn in by the cultural aspects of the Promenade, but it gets worse.  There is actually additional bureaucracy that restricts entry the many homeless who are actually drawn toward this bizarre bazaar.  
Most pedestrians are easily tricked by this contrast, believing that the man who is attempting to make money playing a song on his electric keyboard is much more deserving of their dollar than the lazy bum who did not think to bring his electric instruments.  Stop and watch a performer for a while, wait for a wave of people to come and go.  One will most certainly see that many who donate do not watch the man’s performance nor do they stay around after dropping their dollar in his hat.  They do it out of pity; so they can feel better about themselves.  They easily play along with the bohemian fantasy that the homeless and the performers are one in the same.
At a glance it might be easy to fall prey to the illusion of Santa Monica’s Third Street Promenade.  The offers of wealth and culture could seem more than just painted buildings and hardwood flooring inside the Gap, but a closer inspection yields their hollowness.  Hollow, too, is that promise made by the salty ocean air that the Pacific is within reach.  One must leave the fantasy of the Promenade and cross the busy Ocean Avenue, buzzing with the smells, sounds and sights of reality, before the ocean is within reach.  The Promenade, outside of those concrete barriers, is nothing but a corporation intent on making the most profit possible from given land regardless of what it displaces, whether that is small businesses, the homeless or dreams.  This sacrifice of true culture in exchange for wealth further deforms the American Dream in Los Angeles as one that cannot be shared but instead must be coddled.  The Promenade may appear to be a reincarnation of the old marketplaces and bazaars many left behind to travel to Los Angeles, but beneath the inch of paved tile lies the asphalt headstone to a dream Los Angeles has forever made obsolete.
